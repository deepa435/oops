#In your college notice board system, one thread produces messages (like announcements), and another thread consumes them for display. The producer and consumer must coordinate using wait/notify.
#Create a class MessageBoard with:
#A private String message.
#A boolean field hasMessage.
#Method put(String msg) that waits if hasMessage is true, stores the message, sets hasMessage = true, and calls notify().
#Method get() that waits if hasMessage is false, retrieves the message, sets hasMessage = false, and calls notify().
#Create a Producer thread that sends 3 messages: “Exam on Monday”, “Holiday on Tuesday”, “Workshop on Wednesday”.
#Create a Consumer thread that prints each received message.In the Main class, run both threads together.
